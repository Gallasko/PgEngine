# Texture Placeholder
# 
# The IdleCalibrator system uses Color() for UI elements instead of texture files.
# This placeholder file indicates where texture resources would be placed if needed.
#
# Texture files that could be added:
# - button_normal.png
# - button_hover.png
# - panel_bg.png
# - slider.png
#
# The current implementation uses programmatic colors for simplicity.
